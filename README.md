# Readable

> A blog app built with the React with Redux for state management. For the second project of ReactND Udacity.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:3001 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment

There is a Heroku post build script so that you do not have to compile your React frontend manually, it is done on the server. Simply push to Heroku and it will build and load the client index.html page

## API Server

## Using The Server

### Include An Authorization Header

All requests should use an **Authorization header** to work with your own data:

```js
fetch(
    url,
    {
        headers: { 'Authorization': 'whatever-you-want' }
    }
)
```

You can use the [`BooksAPI.js`](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/src/BooksAPI.js) file from the MyReads Project as a guide for designing your own API calls for this project.

### Comment Counts
Posts retrieved in a list or individually now contain comment counts in the format `post: { commentCount: 0 }`.  This should make it easier to display the number of comments a post has without having to call the comments endpoint for each post.   This count is updated whenever a comment is added or deleted via the `POST /comments` or `DELETE /comments/:id` endpoints.

### API Endpoint

The following endpoints are available:

| Endpoints       | Usage          | Params         |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| `GET /categories` | Get all of the categories available for the app. List is found in `categories.js`. Feel free to extend this list as you desire. |  |
| `GET /:category/posts` | Get all of the posts for a particular category. |  |
| `GET /posts` | Get all of the posts. Useful for the main page when no category is selected. |  |
| `POST /posts` | Add a new post. | **id** - UUID should be fine, but any unique id will work <br> **timestamp** - [Timestamp] Can in whatever format you like, you can use `Date.now()` if you like. <br> **title** - [String] <br> **body** - [String] <br> **author** - [String] <br> **category** -  Any of the categories listed in `categories.js`. Feel free to extend this list as you desire. |
| `GET /posts/:id` | Get the details of a single post. | |

| `GET /posts/:id/comments` | Get all the comments for a single post. | |
| `POST /comments` | Add a comment to a post. | **id** - Any unique ID. As with posts, UUID is probably the best here. <br> **timestamp** - [Timestamp] Get this however you want. <br> **body** - [String] <br> **author** - [String] <br> **parentId** - Should match a post id in the database. |
